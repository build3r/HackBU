- Alexa -> get_gifts(NAME)
- get_gifts(NAME)
  - facebook api, parse for info on NAME
    - pattern matching for specific likes
      - use "like hierarchy" to sort first
    - return top 3 candidates
  - ebay api(top 3 candidates)
    - get "items" relating to keywords from facebook api
    - return (item name: price)
  - Return (item name: price)
- Return parser(top 3 {item name: price} )
  - returns final string value of nicely phrased suggestions
- Send string to Alexa

FUTURE IMPROVEMENT:
- Given a user question about the time of someone's bday, respond with a certain number of days till then
- Filter items based on proximity
- More filtering parameters available with the findItemsByKeywords function
- Sort by seller reviews
